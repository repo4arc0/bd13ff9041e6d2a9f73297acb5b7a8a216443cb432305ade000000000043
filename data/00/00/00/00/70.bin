Master Kaecilius.

11
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,500
那个法事只会让你懊悔
That ritual will bring you only sorrow.

12
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,420
虚伪
Hypocrite!

13
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,650
挑战关卡  比利
Challenge round, Billy.

14
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,880
拜托  比利  开玩笑呢
Come on, Billy. You've got to be messing with me.

15
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,970
没有  医生
No, doctor.

00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,200
《如此美好》  恰克·曼吉欧尼  1977年
Feels So Good, Chuck Mangione, 1977.

17
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,410
真是的  比利  你还说这个会很难呢
Honestly, Billy, you said this one would be hard.

18
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,380
-是1978年  -不  比利
- It's 1978. - No, Billy,

19
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,710
《如此美好》虽然是1978年登上榜单的
while Feels So Good may have charted in 1978,

20
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:27,510
但专辑是1977年12月发行的
the album was released in December, 1977.

21
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,090
-不  维基上说是197...  -再看看
- No, no. Wikipedia says it's a 19... - Check again.

22
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,570
这些无用的信息你都储存在哪啊
Where do you store all this useless information?

23
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:36,000
无用  他单靠粗管短号就能上前十热曲榜
Useless? The man charted a top ten hit with a Flugelhorn.

24
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,790
-怎么样  比利  -1977年
- Status, Billy? - 1977.

25
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,530
拜托  我恨你
Please. I hate you.

26
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:44,000
"如此美好"  是吧
"Feels so good", doesn't it?

27
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,310
我来吧  斯蒂芬
I... I've got this, Stephen.

28
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,510
你该做的做完了  去吧  我们来缝合
You've done your bit. Go ahead, we'll close up.

29
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,700
-怎么了  -枪伤
- What is it? - GSW.

30
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,730
你居然还能保住他的命
It's amazing you kept him alive.

31
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,210
呼吸暂停  脑干测试
Apneic, failed the brain stem test...

32
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,580
和呼吸暂停反射测试均无反应
and the apnea reflex test.

33
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,210
我好像发现问题所在了  帕尔默医生
I think I found the problem, Dr. Palmer.

34
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,640
你把一颗子弹留在了他的脑子里
You left a bullet in his head.

35
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,480
谢谢  它撞到了髓质
Thanks. It's impinging on the medulla.

36
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,160
我需要专家意见  尼克已经判了脑死亡
I needed a specialist. Nic diagnose brain death.

37
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,250
但我就是觉得不对劲
Something about that doesn't feel right to me.

38
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,200
我们得跑了
We have to run.

39
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,780
韦斯特医生  你在做什么
Dr. West! What are you doing?

40
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,640
器官采集  他是捐献者
Organ harvest. He's a donor.

41
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,290
别急  我可没同意
Slow down. I did not agree to that.

42
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,480
我不需要你同意  我们已经判定脑死亡了
I don't need you to. We've already called brain death.

43
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,150
话说早了
Prematurely.

44
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,010
得为他准备进行枕下开颅手术
We need to get him prepped for sub-occipital craniotomy.

45
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,690
我不会让你给死人开刀的
Not gonna let you operate on a dead man.

46
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:25,560
你看到了什么
What do you see?

47
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,450
-一颗子弹  -一颗完好的子弹
- A bullet? - A perfect bullet.

48
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,240
子弹加固过
It's been hardened.

49
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,370
子弹加固是用铅锑合金
You harden a bullet by alloying lead with antimony.

50
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,560
有毒金属
A toxic metal.

51
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,330
而且子弹直接接触脑脊液
And that's leeched directly into the cerebral spinal fluid.

52
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,390
立刻造成中枢神经系统停摆
Rapid-onset central nervous system shutdown.

53
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:37,980
我们得走了
We got to go.

54
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,150
病人没死  但他要死了
The patient's not dead, but he's dying.

55
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,810
还要采集他的器官吗
Still want to harvest his organs?

56
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,870
我来协助你
I'll assist you.

57
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,490
不用  帕尔默医生会协助我的
No! Dr. Palmer will assist me.

58
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,740
谢谢
Thank you.

59
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,440
影像引导  立刻
Image guidance, stat.

60
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,210
没那个时间了
We don't have time for that.

61
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,270
你不能直接用手做
You can't do it freehand.

62
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,210
我能  我就要这么做
I can and I will.

63
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,590
这不是炫耀的时候  斯特兰奇
This isn't a time for showing off, Strange.

64
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,570
那十分钟前
How about ten minutes ago,

65
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,500
你错判了死亡时间时呢
when you called the wrong time of death?

66
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,550
颅神经未受损
Cranial nerves intact.

67
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,810
韦斯特医生  盖住你的表
Dr. West, cover your watch.

68
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,550
你没必要当着众人的面羞辱他的
You know, you didn't have to humiliate him in front of everyone.

69
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,630
我还没必要救他的病人呢  但是嘛...
I didn't have to save his patient, either. But, you know, I

70
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,920
我有时候就是忍不住
sometimes just can't help myself.

71
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,410
-尼克是个好医生  -你来找我了
- Nic is a great doctor. - You came to me.

72
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:53,990
我想听听别人的意见
Yeah, well, I needed a second opinion.

73
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,210
你已经听到了
You had a second opinion.

74
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,770
你想听到好的意见
What you needed was a competent one.

75
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:59,270
所以你更该当我的待命神经外科医生了
Well, all the more reason why you should be my neurosurgeon on call.

76
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,590
你可以做出很大贡献
You could make such a difference.

77
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,570
我不能在你的屠宰场工作
I can't work in your butcher shop.

78
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,380
我在做截断脊髓熔合术
Look, I'm fusing transected spinal cords.

79
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,780
以及刺激中枢神经的神经发生
I'm stimulating neurogenesis in the central nervous system.

80
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,740
我的工作在今后的年月里能拯救上千人
The work I'm doing is gonna save thousands for years to come.

81
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,950
而在急诊室  至多就是救拿枪的笨蛋醉鬼
In ER, you get to save one drunk idiot with a gun.

82
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,250
是啊  我们急诊室的人不过就是在救命
Yeah, you're right. In ER, we're only saving lives.

83
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,770
捞不到名声  没有CNN来采访
There's no fame, there's no CNN interviews...

84
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,950
那我只能继续用尼克了
Well, I guess I'll have to stick with Nic.

85
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,550
等等  你们不是...你俩没...
Oh, wait a minute. You're not... you guys aren't...

86
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,350
什么
What?

87
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,540
上床吧
Sleeping together.

88
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,550
抱歉  我以为我厌恶的口气能暗示我的意思了
Sorry, I thought that was implicit in my disgust.

89
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,950
其实非常明显
Explicit, actually.

90
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,710
没有  我有绝对不能跟同事约会的规矩
And no, I have a very strict rule against dating colleagues.

91
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,550
-是吗  -我称之为"斯特兰奇准则"
- Oh really? - I call it the Strange policy.

92
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:35,660
太棒了  很高兴有东西是以我命名的
Oh, good! I'm glad something's named after me.

93
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,550
我发明了一种椎板切除术手术
You know, I invented a laminectomy procedure,

94
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,290
但不知为何
and yet, somehow,

95
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:40,570
似乎没人愿意管它叫"斯特兰奇术"
no one seems to want to call it the Strange technique.

96
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,310
是我们一起发明了那个术式
We invented that technique.

97
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:45,580
不管怎样  你的准则让我受宠若惊
You know, regardless, I'm very flattered by your policy.

98
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,530
我...
Look, I'm...

99
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,900
我今晚要去参加个神经病学协会的晚宴
I'm talking tonight at a Neurological Society dinner.

100
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,510
一起来吧
Come with me.

101
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:55,170
又是去演讲  真浪漫
Another speaking engagement? So romantic.

102
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,660
你以前可喜欢跟我去参加这类活动了
You used to love coming to those things with me.

103
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,690
-我们很开心的  -不  是你很开心
- We had fun together. - No. You've had fun.

104
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,670
那不是以我们为主  是以你为主
They weren't about us, they were about you.

105
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,810
也不仅仅是我
Not only about me.

106
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:06,520
斯蒂芬  什么事都是以你为中心的
Stephen. Everything is about you.

107
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,990
或许可以用连字符
Maybe we could hyphenate.

108
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,530
斯特兰奇-帕尔默术
Strange-Palmer technique.

109
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:13,930
帕尔默-斯特兰奇术
Palmer-Strange.

110
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,210

35岁的空军上校

嗯  我是可以帮忙
Yeah, well, I could help,

115
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,110
但还有50个人也能帮他
but so could 50 other people.

116
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,000
给我找点值得做的
Find me something worth my time.

68岁女士  晚期脑干胶质细胞瘤
I have a 68-year-old female with an advanced brain stem glioma.

118
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,050
你是想让我破坏我的完美记录吗
Yeah, you want me to screw up my perfect record?

119
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:22,560
绝对不要
Definitely not.

120
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:25,970
22岁女性  脑内有电子植入物
How about a 22-year-old female with an electronic implant in her brain

121
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:28,680
以控制精神分裂症  却被闪电击中
to control schizophrenia struck by lightning?

122
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,330
这个听上去是很有趣
That does sound interesting.

123
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,070
能不能发给我...
Can you send me the...

124
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,580
收到了
got it.

125
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,960
没事的  不会有事的
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

126
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,240
他们做了什么
What did they do?

127
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,460
他们用直升机送你过来的
They rushed you in a chopper.

128
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,520
但找到你费了不少时间
But it took a little while to find you.

129
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,080
你在车里时  修复神经损伤的黄金时期就过去了
The golden hours for nerve damage went by while you were in the car.

130
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,150

给你的身体点时间愈合

我还要多久才能...

164
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:44,110
扯淡  拿他的病例给我

165
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,050
从档案馆里找到他的病例得要点时间
It'll take me a while to pull the files from the archive.

166
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,510
但如果能证明你个自大鬼错了
But if it proves your arrogant ass wrong,

167
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,210

我看过了你所有的研究

I... I don't think you realize how severe the damages are...

184
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,230
如果我能借到钱

- Stephen... Stephen. - A small loan, 200,000.

你一直是挣多少花多少
You've always spent money as fast as you could make it

187
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,030

but now you're spending money you don't even have.

188
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:06,720
或许该考虑停止了
Maybe it's time to consider stopping.

189
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:10,120
不  现在才更不能停止

190
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,870
因为  我并没有好转
Because, you see, I'm not getting any better!

191
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,460
但这已经不是求医了  这是发疯
But this isn't medicine anymore. This is mania.

192
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,980
有些东西就是治不好
Some things just can't be fixed.

193

这不是末路

你现在该走了
This is the part where you leave.

Fine. I can't watch you do this to yourself anymore.

200
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,090
-太艰难了  是吗  -没错

202
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,450
看到你这样令我心碎
It breaks my heart to see you this way.

203
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:45,350
不  别可怜我

204

带奶酪和酒来
Bringing cheese and wine

207
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:50,310
好像我们是去吃野餐的老朋友

我们不是朋友  克里斯汀
We are not friends, Christine.

209
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,220
我们连情人都算不上
We were barely lovers.

210
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,260
你就喜欢悲剧故事  是吧
But you just love a sob story, don't you?

211
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,450
你现在就这么看我了吗
Is that what I am to you now?

Patch him up and send him back into the world,

217
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:09,860
你非常在乎  是吧

I came to your office once. You refused to see me.

232

我连你助理那关都没过
I never got past your assistant.

233

你当时没法医治
You were untreatable.

234

我本来都放弃我的身体了
I'd given up on my body.

240
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,370
我以为我只剩下思维了
I thought my mind's the only thing I had left.

241
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:19,310
至少也该努力提升它一下
I should at least try to elevate that.

242
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,660
所以我去见大师

好吧
All right.

271
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:29,330
你在找卡马塔奇
You're looking for Kamar-Taj?

272
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,210
真的吗
Really?

273
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,230
你确定找对地方了吗
Sure you got the right place?

274
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,880
那里看起来更...
That one looks a little more...

275
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,250
卡马塔奇一些
Kamar Taj-y.

276
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,720
我曾经和你一样
I once stood in your place.

277
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,560
我也曾经...
And I, too, was...

278
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,860
很不敬
disrespectful.

279
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:19,880
我给你点建议
So might I offer you some advice?

280
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,110
忘掉你自以为知道的一切
Forget everything you think you know.

281
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,650
好吧
All right.

282
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,740
这圣殿属于我们的导师
The sanctuary of our teacher.

283
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:40,910
古一法师
The Ancient One.

284
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,920
古一法师  他真名叫什么
The Ancient One? What's his real name?

285
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,280
对了  忘掉我自以为知道的一切  抱歉
Right. Forget everything I think I know. Sorry.

286
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,580
感谢你...
Thank you for...

287
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:06,030
好吧  这是...规矩吗
Okay, that's, uh... a thing...

288
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,370
谢谢
Thank you for...

289
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,680
你好
Hello.

290
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,290
谢谢
Uh, thank you.

291
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,460
也谢谢你
And thank you.

292
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:18,650
感谢你  古一法师  愿意见我
Uh, thank you, Ancient One... for... seeing me...

293
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,250
不客气
You're very welcome.

294
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,750
-古一法师  -谢谢  莫多法师
- The Ancient One. - Thank you, Master Mordo.

295
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,390
谢谢  哈密尔法师
Thank you, Master Hamir!

296
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,120
斯特兰奇先生
Mr. Strange!

297
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:31,850
其实是博士
Doctor, actually.

298
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:34,510
肯定不再是了
Well, no. Not anymore, surely.

299
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,920
你不正是因此而来的吗
Isn't that why you're here?

300
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,090
你做了许多次手术
You've undergone many procedures.

301
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:40,480
-七次  对吧  -对
- Seven, right? - Yeah...

302
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,570
-好茶  -是啊
- It's good tea. - Yes.

303
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:52,860
你是不是治好了一个叫潘伯恩的人  他瘫痪了
Did you heal a man named Pangborn? A paralyzed man.

304
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,920
算是吧
In a way.

305
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,840
你帮了他  他又能走了
You helped him to walk again.

306
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,310
对
Yes.

307
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:01,130
你是怎么治好C7-C8脊椎完全性损伤的
How did you correct a complete C7-C8 spinal cord injury?

308
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,570
不是治好了
I didn't correct it.

309
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,010
他不能走  我让他相信他能
He couldn't walk; I convinced him that he could.

310
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,920
你不是指身心治疗吧
You're not suggesting it was psychosomatic?

311
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,970
你把断掉的神经接好后
When you reattach a severed nerve,

312
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:12,630
是你  还是身体让它痊愈
is it you who heals it back together or the body?

313
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:15,030
-是细胞  -而细胞被设定好
- It's the cells. - And the cells are only programmed

314
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:17,540
以特定的方式来痊愈
to put themselves back together in very specific ways.

315
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:18,410
对
Right.

316
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:21,260
如果我告诉你  你可以说服身体相信
What if I told you that your own body could be convinced

317
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:24,770
它能以各种各样的方式痊愈呢
to put itself back together in all sorts of ways?

318
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:28,260
你是说细胞再生
You're talking about cellular regeneration.

319
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,400
这种技术非常尖端
That's... bleeding-edge medical tech.

320
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,610
所以你才在这里工作吗
Is that why you're working here,

321
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:34,960
脱离医院董事会的监管
without a governing medical board? I mean...

322
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:37,150
你的治疗方法实验性多强
just how experimental is your treatment?

323
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,350
非常强
Quite.

324
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:45,440
所以  你有办法让神经细胞重组自愈吗
So, you've figured out a way to reprogram nerve cells to self-heal?

325
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,250
不  斯特兰奇先生
No, Mr. Strange.

326
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:52,700
我知道如何调整精神力量  使身体更好地愈合
I know how to reorient the spirit to better heal the body.

327
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:56,100
精神力量...愈合身体
The spirit... to heal the body.

328
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,120
没错
That's right.

329
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,360
好吧
No. Al... Al... All right.

330
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,680
我们要怎么做  从哪开始
How do we do that? Where do we start?

331
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,730
不喜欢那张图吗
Don't like that map?

332
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,250
不是的  它真的很不错
Oh, no. It's... it's really good.

333
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,380
只是...我以前见过这个
It's just... you know, I've seen it before.

334
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,490
在礼品店里
In gift shops.

335
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,120
那这张呢
And what about this one?

336
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,950
-针灸  厉害  -是吧
- Acupuncture, great. - Yeah?

337
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,910
那张怎么样
What about... that one?

338
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:28,210
你是在给我看核磁共振图吗  难以置信
Showing me an MRI scan? I do not believe this.

339
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:32,130
画每张图的人  都只能窥视局部
Each of those maps was drawn up by someone who could see in part,

340
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,330
而看不到全局
but not the whole.

341
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:35,120
我为来这儿  花了最后的一点钱
I spent my last dollar getting here

342
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:35,910
买了张单程票
one-way ticket,

343
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:39,350
你却在跟我说信仰治疗
and you're talking to me about healing through belief?

344
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,840
你是一个通过钥匙孔窥视世界的人
You're a man looking at the world through a keyhole,

345
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:44,720
你这一生  都在试图扩大那个钥匙孔
you've spent your whole life trying to widen that keyhole.

346
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:46,710
想看到更多  知道更多
To see more, to know more.

347
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:49,620
而如今听闻  这钥匙孔可以扩大
And now, on hearing that it can be widen

348
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:53,090
是以你无法想象的方式  你却抗拒这个可能性吗
in ways you can't imagine, you reject the possibility?

349
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:55,780
不  我拒绝是因为我不信天方夜谭
No, I reject it because I do not believe in fairy tales

350
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:59,320
什么脉轮  能量  信仰的力量
about chakras, or energy, or the power of belief.

351
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,850
根本没有精神力量这东西
There is no such thing as spirit!

352
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,410
我们都由物质构成  别无他物
We are made of matter, and nothing more.

353
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:08,210
你只是一粒小小的  转瞬即逝的尘埃
You're just another tiny, momentary speck

354
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:10,030
漂浮在这冷漠的世界里
within an indifferent universe.

355
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,340
你太妄自菲薄了
You think too little of yourself.

356
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,500
你自以为能看穿我  是吗
You think you see through me, do you?

357
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,640
你才不能呢
Well, you don't.

358
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:18,020
我倒是看穿你了
But I see through you!!

359
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,050
你刚对我做了什么
What did you just do to me?!

360
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:39,350
我将你的魂体打出了你的肉体
I pushed your astral form out of your physical form.

361
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,450
那杯茶里加了什么
What's in that tea?

362
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:42,910
裸头草碱[迷幻药]  还是迷幻剂
Psilocybin? LSD?

363
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:44,060
就是茶
It's just tea.

364
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,060
加了一点蜂蜜
With a little honey.

365
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,550
刚发生了什么
What just happened?

366
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:50,670
那一瞬间  你进入了精神次元
For a moment, you entered the astral dimension.

367
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:54,430
-什么  -魂魄与躯壳不共生的地方
- The what? - A place where the soul exists apart from the body.

368
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:56,230
你为什么要这样对我
Why are you doing this to me?

369
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,770
为了让你明白你有多无知
To show you just how much you don't know.

370
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:01,850
睁开你的眼睛
Open your eye.

371
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,490
该死
Shit!

372
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:10,290
上帝啊  上帝啊
Oh god! Oh god!

373
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,470
不不不不不
No. No. No. No. No. No.

374
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:13,570
怎么回事
What's happening?

375
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:14,560
这不是真的  不是真的
This isn't real. This isn't real.

376
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,110
不是真的  这是...
This isn't real. This is...

377
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:22,470
上帝啊
Oh god!

378
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,610
不不不不不
No. No. No. No. No. No.

379
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:29,500
他的心率太高  有点危险
His heart rate is getting dangerously high.

380
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,280
我看他挺好的
He looks all right to me.

381
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:41,040
你自以为明白这世界如何运转
You think you know how the world works?

382
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:45,130
你以为这物质宇宙就是全部了吗
You think that this material universe is all there is?

383
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,060
何为真实
What is real?

384
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,680
你感官无法触及之处  还有怎样的奥秘
What mysteries lie beyond the reach of your senses?

385
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:03,620
在万物存在的根源处  思维与物质交合
At the root of existence, mind and matter meet.

386
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:07,100
思维塑造现实
Thoughts shape reality.

387
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:23,740
这个宇宙不过无数个宇宙之一
This universe is only one of an infinite number.

388
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,110
无尽的世界
Worlds without end.

389
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:31,700
有些世界充满仁爱与生命
Some benevolent and life-giving;

390
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:37,950
有些则满是恶念与饥荒
Others filled with malice and hunger.

391
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:46,100
还有黑暗之地  存在着比时间更古老的力量
Dark places, where powers older than time lie...

392
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,660
贪婪地
ravenous...

393
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,720
等待着
and waiting.

394
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:01,330
在浩瀚的多元宇宙间  你是谁
Who are you in this vast multiverse,

395
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,910
斯特兰奇先生
Mr. Strange?

396
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,070
你在礼品店见过这个吗
Have you seen that before in a gift shop?

397
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:34,900
教教我
Teach me!

398
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,790
不
No.

399
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,410
不...
No...

400
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,660
不要
No!

401
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:49,040
不不不不  不要
No, no, no, no no no no!

402
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:54,730
不要  开门  求你了
No! Open the door! Please!

403
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,180
谢谢  各位法师
Thank you, Masters.

404
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:06,240
你觉得我不该赶他走吗
You think I was wrong to cast him out?

405
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:09,050
五小时了  他还在你门口
5 hours later, he's still on your doorstep.

406
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:11,700
他身上有股力量
There's a strength to him.

407
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:16,740
顽固  自负  野心...我都见过
Stubbornness, arrogance, ambition... I've seen it all before.

408
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,070
他让你想起了卡西利亚斯吗
He reminds you of Kaecilius?

409
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:22,420
我不能再教另一个天赋异禀的学生学会强大法术
I cannot lead another gifted student to power,

410
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,560
再看着他被黑暗吞噬
only to lose him to the darkness.

411
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,130
我就没有那样
You didn't lose me.

412
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,930
我想获得力量  打败敌人
I wanted the power to defeat my enemies.

413
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:34,510
你给了我力量打败心魔
You gave me the power to defeat my demons.

414
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:37,860
并遵守自然法则
And to live within the natural law.

415
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,340
我们永远不能摆脱心魔  莫多
We never lose our demons, Mordo.

416
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:43,540
我们只能学会抑制它们
We only learn to live above them.

417
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,430
被偷的几页书还在卡西利亚斯手上
Kaecilius still has the stolen pages.

418
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:52,080
如果他成功破解  就能毁灭我们所有人
If he deciphers them, he could bring ruin upon us all.

419
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,360
黑暗的日子可能就要到来
There may be dark days ahead.

420
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,880
卡马塔奇或许用得上斯特兰奇这样的人
Perhaps Kamar-Taj could use a man like Strange.

421
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,650
别把我挡在外面
Don't shut me out.

422
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:15,940
我没别的地方可去了
I haven't got anywhere else to go.

423
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,030
谢谢
Thank you.

424
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:28,280
洗澡
Bathe.

425
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,340
休息
Rest.

426
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,640
或是冥想
Meditate...

427
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,230
如果你可以的话
if you can.

428
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:37,050
古一法师会派人来找你的
The Ancient One will send for you.

429
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,240
这是什么  我的咒语吗
What's this? My mantra?

430
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,280
是无线网密码
The Wi-Fi password.

431
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,240
我们又不是野蛮人
We're not savages.

432
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:18,750
{\an8}{\pos(329,173)}时间会表明
我爱你多深
~
克里斯汀

433
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:29,750
魔法的语言和人类文明一样古老
The language of the mystic arts is as old as civilization.

434
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,100
古代的法师
The sorcerers of antiquity

435
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:35,250
把这种语言的使用称为"咒语"
called the use of this language "Spells".

436
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:37,820
但如果这个词有违你的现代思维
But if that word offends your modern sensibilities,

437
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:40,150
你可以把它称作"程序"
you can call it a "Program".

438
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:43,390
它是塑造了现实的源代码
The source code that shapes reality.

439
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,000
我们汲取能量
We harness energy

440
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:50,660
来自多元宇宙其他次元的能量
drawn from other dimensions of the multiverse,

441
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:53,800
来施咒
to cast spells,

442
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:57,830
变出护盾
to conjure shields

443
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,680
和武器
and weapons

444
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:03,410
创造魔法
to make magic.

445
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,050
但是
But...

446
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:20,640
即使我的手指可以做到
even if my fingers could do that,

447
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:24,410
我的手也只是在胡乱挥舞而已
my hands would just be waving in the air. I mean,

448
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:26,620
我怎么才能达到你那种程度呢
how do I get from here to there?

449
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,310
那你是如何能连接断裂的神经
How did you get to reattach severed nerves, and

450
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:33,140
一节一节地修复人的脊椎呢
put a human spine back together bone by bone?

451
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,620
多年的学习和练习
Study and practice. Years of it.

452
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:51,450
-斯特兰奇先生  -叫我斯蒂芬就好
- Mr. Strange. - Stephen, please.

453
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:54,330
-那你是  -王
- And you are? - Wong.

454
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:55,280
王
Wong.

455
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,170
就单一个王吗
Just Wong?

456
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:59,030
就像  阿黛尔
Like... Adele?

457
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,980
或者  亚里士多德
Or... Aristotle.

458
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,590
德雷克
Drake.

459
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,110
博诺
Bono.

460
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,650
阿姆
Eminem.

461
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:16,430
《幻日之书》
The Book of the Invisible Sun.

462
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,750
《新天文学》
Astronomia Nova.

463
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,000
《统御法典》
Codex Imperium.

464
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:22,780
《所罗门钥匙》
Key of Solomon.

465
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:27,390
-你全都看完了吗  -对
- You finished all of this? - Yup.

466
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,790
-跟我来  -好
- Come with me. - All right.

467
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,050
这个区域仅对法师开放
This section is for Masters only.

468
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:36,450
但如果有我的允许  其他人也可以看
But at my discretion, others may use it.

469
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:39,820
从《马克西姆的启蒙》开始看吧
We should start with Maxim's Primer.

470
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:44,770
你的梵文怎么样
How's your Sanskrit?

471
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,000
我谷歌翻译用得挺溜
I'm fluent in Google Translate.

472
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,400
吠陀  古典梵语
Vedic, classical Sanskrit.

473
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:56,780
那些是什么
What are those?

474
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,760
古一法师的私人收藏
The Ancient One's private collection.

475
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:01,670
所以禁止阅览吗
So they're forbidden?

476
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:04,310
卡马塔奇没有禁止阅览的知识
No knowledge in Kamar-Taj is forbidden.

477
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:06,000
只有个别禁施的法术
Only certain practices.

478
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:08,750
除了至尊法师
Those books are far too advanced

479
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,300
那些书对其他人来说太过深奥
for anyone other than the Sorcerer Supreme.

480
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,230
这本书有缺页
This one's got pages missing.

481
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:28,900
那是《卡里奥斯特罗之书》  是研究时间的
That's the Book of Cagliostro. A study of time.

482
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:32,670
一个前法师偷走了一个法事
One of the rituals was stolen by a former Master.

483
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:35,870
是个狂热信徒  叫卡西利亚斯
The zealot, Kaecilius.

484
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:40,450
他还把前任图书管理员吊了起来
Just after he strung up the former librarian,

485
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,660
并砍下了他的首级
and relieved him of his head.

486
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,550
现在我来守卫这些书
I am now the guardian of these books.

487
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:51,230
所以如果再有一本藏书被偷
So if a volume from this collection should be stolen again,

488
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:52,870
我都会知道
I'd know it.

489
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:56,440
你还不及离开这里就会没命
And you'd be dead before you ever left the compound.

490
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,150
那如果只是逾期了呢
What if it's just overdue? You know?

491
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,140
会有什么逾期费吗  打个伤残什么的
Any... late fees I should know about? Maiming, perhaps.

492
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,100
知道吗  以前大家都觉得我很幽默呢
You know, people used to think that I was funny.

493
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,430
他们是你的手下吗
Did they work for you?

494
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:14,700
好吧  跟你谈话真愉快
All right. Well, it's been lovely talking to you,

495
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:18,480
谢谢你给我找书  给我讲恐怖故事
thank you for the books and for the horrifying story and

496
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,490
并对我进行人身威胁
for the threat upon my life.

497
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,680
现在我们将得到力量消灭背叛我们的人
We will now receive the power to destroy the one who betrayed us.

498
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:00,040
也是背叛世界的人
The one who betrays the world.

499
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:03,500
掌握悬戒是学习魔法必不可少的
Mastery of the sling ring is essential to the mystic arts.

500
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:06,910
悬戒让我们可以在多元宇宙中穿行
They allow us to travel throughout the multiverse.

501
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,180
你所要做的就是集中精神
All you need to do is focus.

502
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:10,900
去想象
Visualize.

503
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:13,700
在脑海中勾勒出目的地
See the destination in your mind.

504
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:17,230
目光超越你面前的世界
Look beyond the world in front of you.

505
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:21,040
想象出每个细节
Imagine every detail.

506
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:25,580
画面越清晰  召唤传送门就会
The clearer the picture, the quicker, and easier,

507
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:27,900
越快  越容易
the gateway will come.

508
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,750
停下
And stop.

509
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:35,720
我想和斯特兰奇先生单独谈谈
I would like a moment alone with Mr. Strange.

510
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:37,590
没问题
Of course.

511
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:44,140
-都怪我的手  -这和你的手无关
- My hands. - It's not about your hands.

512
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:46,350
这怎么会和我的手无关
How is this not about my hands?

513
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:47,750
哈密尔法师
Master Hamir.

514
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,760
有劳了  哈密尔法师
Thank you, Master Hamir.

515
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:07,220
你无法打得河流服从你
You cannot beat a river into submission.

516
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,110
你得顺应它的流势
You have to surrender to its current,

517
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:12,080
化其力量为己用
and use its power as your own.

518
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,820
我要放弃掌控  才能掌控它吗
I... I control it by surrendering control?

519
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:15,960
那根本没道理啊
That doesn't make any sense.

520
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,760
并非凡事都有道理  也并非都必须有道理
Not everything does. Not everything has to.

521
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:22,150
你的智力引领了你的人生
Your intellect has taken you far in life.

522
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:23,830
但它不会让你更进一步了
But it will take you no further.

523
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:25,890
顺从吧  斯蒂芬
Surrender, Stephen.

524
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,040
放下你的自负
Silence your ego

525
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,570
你的力量才会显现
and your power will rise.

526
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:32,340
跟我来
Come with me.

527
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:40,980
-等等  这是不是...  -珠穆朗玛峰
- Wait. Is this... - Everest.

528
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,230
-真美  -没错
- Beautiful. - Yeah, right.

529
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,810
很美  很冷  但...很美
Beautiful. Freezing, but... beautiful.

530
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:52,560
在这种温度下  人只能存活30分钟
At this temperature, a person can last for 30 minutes

531
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,070
-然后就会永久丧失身体机能  -太好了
- before suffering permanent loss of function. - Great.

532
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:59,160
但前两分钟内你大概就会休克
But you'll likely go into shock within the first 2.

533
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:00,970
什么
What?

534
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:04,630
-顺从吧  斯蒂芬  -不不  不要
- Surrender, Stephen. - No, no!!! Don't!

535
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:16,290
-新来的怎么样了  -即将见分晓
- How's our new recruit? - We shall see.

536
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:19,050
随时了
Any second now.

537
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:22,540
不会吧  又来
No, not again.

538
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,990
或许我该...
Maybe I should...

539
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:45,210
-斯蒂芬  -王
- Stephen. - Wong.

540
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:47,980
-你要什么  斯特兰奇  -魂体投射的书
- What do you want, Strange? - Books on astral projection.

541
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:52,240
-你还没准备好  -放马过来  碧昂斯
- You're not ready for that. - Try me, Beyonce.

542
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:58,630
得了  你听说过她吧  她可是大腕啊
Come on. You've heard of her. She's a huge star, right?

543
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,370
你笑过吗
Do you ever laugh?

544
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,120
得了  把书给我吧
Come on, just give me the book.

545
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,210
不行
No.

546
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:38,560
就在这个房间  你曾求我教你
Once, in this room, you begged me to let you learn.

547
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,580
如今我却听说  你质疑所有教导
Now I'm told you question every lesson,

548
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:43,260
而更喜欢自学
prefering to teach yourself.

549
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:45,420
就在这个房间  你曾要我睁开眼睛
Once, in this room, you told me to open my eyes.

550
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:49,170
如今我却听说  要盲目遵守毫无道理的规矩
Now I'm being told to blindly accept rules that make no sense.

551
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:52,350
比如不能在图书馆里开传送门吗
Like the rule against conjuring a gateway in the library?

552
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:53,550
王打我小报告
Wong told on me?

553
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:55,900
你的魔法法术进步很快
You're advancing quickly with your sorcery skills.

554
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:59,550
你需要一个安全的地方练习咒语
You need a safe space to practice your spells.

555
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:19,960
你现在处于镜像次元中
You are now inside the Mirror Dimension.

556
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,080
永恒存在但不会被发觉
Ever present but undetected.

557
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:25,100
这里的事不会影响真实世界
The real world isn't affected by what happens here.

558
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:29,690
我们在镜像次元中训练  监视
We use the Mirror Dimension to train, surveil,

559
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:32,560
也会用它来控制威胁
and sometimes to contain threats.

560
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:35,340
千万不要没戴悬戒被困在这里
You don't wanna be stuck in here without your sling ring.

561
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:37,980
等等  抱歉  你刚说的威胁是什么意思
Hold on. Sorry, what do you mean, threats?

562
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:49,830
了解无穷的多元宇宙
Learning of an infinite multiverse

563
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:52,290
就也要了解无尽的危险
includes learning of infinite dangers.

564
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:55,200
如果我把所有你尚不知道的东西都告诉你
And if I told you everything else that you don't already know,

565
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,960
你只会仓皇逃跑
you'd run from here in terror.

566
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:05,440
话说  她究竟有多老
So, just how ancient is she?

567
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:10,290
没人知道至尊法师的年龄
No one knows the age of the Sorcerer Supreme.

568
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:13,730
只知道她是凯尔特人  从不提起往事
Only that she is Celtic and never talks about her past.

569
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,870
你不了解她还追随她
You follow her even though you don't know?

570
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:18,400
我知道她坚定不移  却又高深莫测
I know that she's steadfast, but unpredictable.

571
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:20,550
无情  却有仁爱之心
Merciless, yet kind.

572
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,120
是她成就了如今的我
She made me what I am.

573
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:26,610
相信你的导师
Trust your teacher.

574
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:29,110
切勿迷失方向
And don't lose your way.

575
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,170
-像卡西利亚斯那样吗  -对
- Like Kaecilius? - That's right.

576
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:37,790
你认识他
You knew him.

577
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:42,080
他刚来时  失去了所有挚爱之人
When he first came to us, he'd lost everyone he ever loved.

578
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,870
他悲痛欲绝
He was a grieving, broken man,

579
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:46,000
在魔法中寻找答案
searching for answers in the mystic arts.

580
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,660
他是个才华横溢的学生  但自傲又顽固
A brilliant student, but he was proud, headstrong.

581
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:52,610
他质疑古一法师  排斥我们的教导
He questioned the Ancient One, rejected our teaching.

582
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:01,140
他离开了卡马塔奇
He left Kamar-Taj.

583
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:03,990
他的门徒如羊群般跟随
His disciples followed him like sheep

584
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:06,390
被伪教义迷惑
seduced by false doctrine.

585
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:09,880
-他偷了一个禁忌法事  对吗  -对
- He stole the forbidden ritual, right? - Yes.

586
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:11,160
那是干什么的
What did it do?

587
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:14,820
别再问问题了
No more questions.

588
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,550
-那是什么  -这也是问题
- What's that? - That's a question.

589
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:21,630
这是个法器
This is a relic.

590
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:24,450
有些魔法太过强大  无法维持
Some magic is too powerful to sustain,

591
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:26,370
我们唯有将其注入物件之中
so we imbue objects with it.

592
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,190
让它们去承受我们承受不了的负担
Allowing them to take the strain we can not.

593
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:30,220
这
This

594
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:34,220
就是生命法庭权杖
is the Staff of the Living Tribunal.

595
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,090
有很多法器
There are many relics.

596
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:40,790
瓦图姆魔杖
The Wand of Watoomb.

597
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:43,080
佛多之靴
The Vaulting Boots of Valtorr.

598
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:45,540
真是朗朗上口  对吧
Really just roll off the tongue, don't they?

599
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:47,450
我什么时候能有自己的法器
When do I get my relic?

600
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:49,510
-等你准备好  -我觉得我准备好了
- When you're ready. - I think I'm ready.

601
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:52,280
法器觉得你准备好了  你才算准备好了
You're ready when the relic decides you're ready.

602
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:54,060
现在
For now,

603
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:56,670
变出一个武器来吧
conjure a weapon.

604
00:47:57,850 --> 00:47:58,800
好吧
All right.

605
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:06,550
战斗
Fight!

606
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:09,550
就好像你命系于此
Fight like your life depended on it!

607
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:17,920
因为有一天  或许真会如此
Because one day, it may.

608
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:41,280
{\an8}{\pos(187,155)}克里斯汀

609
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,950
{\an8}{\pos(171,161)}我再给你发一次邮件

610
00:49:28,610 --> 00:49:29,540
王
Wong?

611
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,240
好了
Okay.

612
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:47,240
首先  打开阿戈摩托之眼
First, open the Eye of Agamotto.

613
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:08,570
好吧
All right.

614
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:33,220
我的天
Oh my.

615
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:48,760
能不能...
What if...

616
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:12,340
多玛姆
Dormammu.

617
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:15,510
黑暗次元
The Dark Dimension.

618
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:17,900
永生
Eternal life?

619
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:24,020
怎么...
What the...

620
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,350
停下
Stop!!!

621
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:31,440
干涉时空连续性是大忌
Tampering with continuum probabilitie is forbidden!

622
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,120
我只是...在照书上的指示操作
I... I wa... I was just doing exactly what it said in the book!

623
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:35,200
那进行法事的危险
And what did the book say

624
00:51:35,290 --> 00:51:36,970
书上是怎么说的呢
about the dangers of performing that ritual?

625
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:38,740
我不知道  我还没看到那儿
I don't know. I hadn't gotten to that part yet.

626
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:41,820
操纵时间会创建出时间分支
Temporal manipulations can create branches in time.

627
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:44,440
不稳定的次元开口
Unstable dimensional openings.

628
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:46,970
空间悖论  时间循环
Spatial paradoxes! Time loops!!!

629
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:50,400
你想被困在一遍遍重复的时间段里吗
You wanna get stuck reliving the same moment over, and over, forever,

630
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:52,120
或是存在完全被抹去
or never having existed at all?

631
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:55,080
警告真的应该放在咒语前
Really should put the warnings before the spell.

632
00:51:55,310 --> 00:51:57,420
你的好奇心可能会害死你
Your curiosity could have gotten you killed.

633
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:59,880
你不是在操纵时空连续性
You weren't manipulating the space-time continuum,

634
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:01,140
而是在破坏它
you were breaking it.

635
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:04,450
我们不打破自然法则
We do not tamper with natural law.

636
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:05,440
而是保卫它
We defend it.

637
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:06,950
你怎么做到的
How did you even do that?

638
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,280
你从哪学到的理解它所需要的
Where did you learn the litany of spells required

639
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:11,310
冗长的咒语
to even understand it?

640
00:52:11,310 --> 00:52:12,610
我过目不忘
I've got a photographic memory.

641
00:52:12,610 --> 00:52:14,720
所以才能同时拿到医学和哲学博士学位
That's how I got my M.D. and Ph.D. at the same time.

642
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,900
你刚刚做到的
What you just did

643
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,840
需要的不仅是好记性
takes more than a good memory.

644
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,590
你就是为魔法而生的
You were born for the mystic arts.

645
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:24,350
-但我的手还在抖  -暂时还在抖
- And yet, my hands still shake. - For now, yes.

646
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:26,750
-不会永远如此吗  -我们不是先知
- Not forever? - We're not prophets.

647
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:28,730
你们什么时候才肯告诉我  我们是什么
When are you gonna start telling me what we are?

648
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:35,620
复仇者那样的英雄
While heroes like the Avengers

649
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:38,040
保护世界免受实体伤害
protect the world from physical dangers,

650
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:41,970
而我们法师捍卫世界  抵御魔法威胁
we sorcerers safeguard it against more mystical threats.

651
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:46,840
古一法师是最新一位继承了至尊法师头衔的人
The Ancient One is the latest in a long line of Sorcerers Supreme.

652
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:50,450
他们可追溯至千百年前的魔法鼻祖
Going back thousands of years to the father of the mystic arts,

653
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:52,000
全能的阿戈摩托
the mighty Agamotto.

654
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,690
就是那个创造了被你鲁莽借用的魔眼法器的法师
Same sorcerer who created the eye you so recklessly borrowed.

655
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:01,910
阿戈摩托在魔力强的地方造了三座圣殿
Agamotto built 3 Sanctums in places of power,

656
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:03,770
这些地方如今都是大城市
where great cities now stand.

657
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:06,510
那扇门通往香港圣殿
That door leads to the Hong Kong Sanctum,

658
00:53:07,090 --> 00:53:09,000
那扇通往纽约圣殿
that door to the New York Sanctum.

659
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,680
那扇通往伦敦圣殿
That one, to the London Sanctum.

660
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:13,710
三座圣殿一起
Together, the Sanctums

661
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:16,820
生成了一面保护世界的盾牌
generate a protective shield around our world.

662
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:19,040
圣殿保护世界
The Sanctums protect the world,

663
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:22,430
我们法师保护圣殿
and we sorcerers protect the Sanctums.

664
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:24,130
抵御什么
From what?

665
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:27,530
其他次元里威胁我们宇宙的存在
Other-dimensional beings that threaten our universe.

666
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,070
比如多玛姆
Like Dormammu?

667
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:32,100
你从哪知道的这个名字
Where did you learn that name?

668
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:35,800
我刚在《卡里奥斯特罗之书》里读到的  怎么了
I just read it in the book of Cagliostro. Why?

669
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:43,390
多玛姆存在于黑暗次元中
Dormammu dwells in the Dark Dimension.

670
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:45,840
超越时间
Beyond time.

671
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:50,950
他是宇宙征服者  世界摧毁者
He is the cosmic conquerer, the destroyer of worlds.

672
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:54,660
拥有无尽力量和无限渴望
A being of infinite power and endless hunger,

673
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:57,380
他想要侵略所有宇宙
on a quest to invade every universe

674
00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:00,600
把所有世界都纳入他的黑暗次元
and bring all worlds into his Dark Dimension.

675
00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:03,520
他最渴望地球
And he hungers for Earth most of all.

676
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:07,010
卡西利亚斯偷的那几页
The pages that Kaecilius stole.

677
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:09,020
一种联系多玛姆
A ritual to contact Dormammu

678
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:11,470
并从黑暗次元中汲取能量的法事
and draw power from the Dark Dimension.

679
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:16,200
好吧
Okay.

680
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:17,670
好吧
Okay.

681
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,280
我退出  我...
I'm out. I...

682
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:23,370
我是来治手的
I came here to heal my hands,

683
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:27,300
不是来打什么魔法战争
not to fight in some mystical war.

684
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:30,820
伦敦
London.

685
00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:36,030
卡西利亚斯
Kaecilius!

686
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:37,460
不
No!!!

687
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,650
王  莫多
Wong? Mordo?

688
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:23,720
{\an8}{\pos(197,72)}布里克街117A

689
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:37,550
有人吗
Hello?

690
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,110
有人吗
Hello?

691
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:47,770
丹尼尔
Daniel.

692
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:50,450
他们任命你为这座圣殿的法师了啊
I see they made you Master of this Sanctum.

693
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:52,720
你知道那意味着什么吗
You know what that means?

694
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,590
你会为保护它而死
That you'll die protecting it.

695
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:13,000
住手
Stop!

696
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:26,810
你到卡马塔奇多久了  你叫...
How long have you been at Kamar-Taj, Mister...?

697
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:27,920
是博士
Doctor.

698
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:32,590
-博士先生  -我姓斯特兰奇[是挺怪]
- Mr Doctor? - It's Strange.

699
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:35,110
也许吧
Maybe.

700
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:36,950
这又不由我来说
Who am I to judge?

701
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,640
你不知道怎么用  是吧
You don't know how to use that, do you?

702
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:49,950
什么
What?

703
01:01:55,410 --> 01:01:56,220
别说了
Stop it.

704
01:01:57,060 --> 01:01:57,850
叫你别说了
I said, stop it!

705
01:01:57,850 --> 01:01:59,360
你阻止不了它的  博士先生
You cannot stop this, Mr. Doctor.

706
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:01,650
听着  我都不知道"它"是什么
Why... look, I don't even know what "This" is.

707
01:02:02,310 --> 01:02:04,810
它既是开始也是结束
It's the end and the beginning.

708
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:08,390
多数人变成少数人  变成唯一
The many becoming the few, becoming the One.

709
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:11,300
你要是不想说明白
Look, if you're not gonna start making sense,

710
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:13,130
我就再给你戴上它
I'm just gonna have to put this thing back on.

711
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:14,310
告诉我  博士先生
Tell me, Mr. Doctor.

712
01:02:14,310 --> 01:02:17,930
听着  我叫斯蒂芬·斯特兰奇博士
All right, look. My name is Dr. Stephen Strange.

713
01:02:17,930 --> 01:02:19,410
-你是博士  -对
- You are a doctor? - Yeah.

714
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:20,720
科学家
A scientist.

715
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:23,090
你懂自然规律
You understand the laws of nature.

716
01:02:23,110 --> 01:02:26,010
一切事物都会变老死去
All things age. All things die.

717
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:27,990
最终  太阳将燃尽
In the end, our sun burns out,

718
01:02:27,990 --> 01:02:30,470
我们的宇宙将变冷毁灭
our universe grows cold and perishes.

719
01:02:30,910 --> 01:02:32,190
但黑暗次元
But the Dark Dimension...

720
01:02:33,470 --> 01:02:34,900
那个地方超越了时间
it's a place beyond time.

721
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:36,840
够了  我再给你戴上
That's it. I'm putting this thing back on.

722
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,570
这个世界不非得灭亡  博士
This world doesn't have to die, Doctor.

723
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:41,400
这个世界有权和其他很多世界一样
This world can take its rightful place alongside so many others,

724
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:42,500
成为唯一的一部分
as part of the One.

725
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,590
伟大而美丽的唯一
The great and beautiful One.

726
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:47,180
我们都能永生
And we can all live forever.

727
01:02:47,870 --> 01:02:48,670
是嘛
Really?

728
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:54,720
这个新时代乌托邦次元对你有什么好处
What do you have to gain out of this New Age dimensional utopia?

729
01:02:55,490 --> 01:02:57,520
跟你  跟所有人一样
The same as you. The same as everyone.

730
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,310
生命  永恒的生命
Life. Eternal life.

731
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:01,690
人们总是从善恶角度思考
People think in terms of good and evil,

732
01:03:01,690 --> 01:03:04,020
但其实时间才是所有人真正的敌人
when really, time is the true enemy of us all.

733
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:05,790
时间会杀死一切
Time kills everything.

734
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:07,810
那你杀死的人呢
What about the people you killed?

735
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:10,170
那都只是微小  转瞬即逝的尘埃
Tiny, momentary specks

736
01:03:10,170 --> 01:03:11,710
漂浮在这冷漠的世界里
within an indifferent universe.

737
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:15,310
是的  你明白了吧
Yes. You see,

738
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:17,790
你明白我们在做什么了吧
you see what we're doing?

739
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:20,620
这世界不是它应该有的样子
The world is not what it ought to be.

740
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:22,970
人类渴望永恒
Humanity longs for the eternal,

741
01:03:23,530 --> 01:03:25,950
渴望超越时间的世界  因为时间奴役我们
for a world beyond time, because time is what enslaves us.

742
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:27,880
时间是一种侮辱
Time is an insult.

743
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:29,960
死亡是一种侮辱
Death is an insult.

744
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:32,430
博士
Doctor...

745
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,530
我们不求统治世界
We don't seek to rule this world.

746
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:38,780
我们求的是拯救它  把它交给多玛姆
We seek to save it, to hand it over to Dormammu,

747
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:41,390
他才是一切进化的目的
who is the intent of all evolution,

748
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:44,160
才是一切生命存在的缘由
the Why of all existence.

749
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:47,870
至尊法师保卫生命
The Sorcerer Supreme defends existence.

750
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:51,630
是什么让你前往卡马塔奇  博士
What was it that brought you to Kamar-Taj, Doctor?

751
01:03:51,630 --> 01:03:53,260
是教化
Was it enlightenment?

752
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:54,810
还是力量
Power?

753
01:03:57,070 --> 01:03:59,620
你是想去被治愈  我们都是
You came to be healed, as did we all.

754
01:04:01,230 --> 01:04:03,920
卡马塔奇吸纳了各种残破的东西
Kamar-Taj is a place that collects broken things.

755
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:05,750
我们都是为治愈的希望而来
We all come with the promise of being healed,

756
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:08,830
但结果  古一只教我们些雕虫小技
and instead, the Ancient One gives us parlor tricks.

757
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:12,150
真正的魔法被她据为己有
The real magic she keeps for herself.

758
01:04:12,830 --> 01:04:15,620
你就没想过她是怎么活得这么久的吗
You ever wondered how she managed to live this long?

759
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:24,020
我在《卡里奥斯特罗之书》中看到了那些法事
I saw the rituals in the book of Cagliostro.

760
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:25,950
看来你知道
So, you know.

761
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,050
法事给了我
The ritual gives me the power

762
01:04:28,050 --> 01:04:31,380
打倒古一  拆毁圣殿的力量
to overthrow the Ancient One and tear her Sanctums down,

763
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,860
好让黑暗次元进来
to let the Dark Dimension in.

764
01:04:34,330 --> 01:04:37,820
因为古一私藏的  多玛姆会无私给予
Because what the Ancient One hoards, Dormammu gives freely.

765
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:40,660
生命  永生
Life, everlasting.

766
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,490
他不是世界的毁灭者  博士
He is not the destroyer of worlds, Doctor,

767
01:04:43,490 --> 01:04:45,810
而是世界的拯救者
he is the savior of worlds.

768
01:04:46,450 --> 01:04:49,270
不  拜托  看看你的脸
No. I mean, come on. Look at your face.

769
01:04:49,890 --> 01:04:51,550
多玛姆把你变成了凶手
Dormammu made you a murderer.

770
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:54,030
他的王国又能好到哪去
Just how good can his kingdom be?

771
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:57,860
你觉得这很有趣
You think that's funny?

772
01:04:58,440 --> 01:04:59,840
不是因为那个
No. Not that.

773
01:05:00,290 --> 01:05:02,960
有趣的是  你的悬戒丢了
What's funny is that you've lost your sling ring.

774
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:12,030
先生  要帮忙吗
Sir, can I help you?

775
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:13,480
帕尔默医生  她在哪
Dr. Palmer, where is she?

776
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:15,060
-先生  我们得...  -她在哪
- Sir, we need to get... - Where is she?

777
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:16,190
在护士站
The nurses station.

778
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:17,840
克里斯汀
Christine!

779
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:20,740
斯蒂芬
Stephen?

780
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:22,030
天啊  怎么
Oh my god. What...

781
01:06:22,030 --> 01:06:24,600
你得马上带我找个手术室  就你一个人
You need to get me in an operating theater now. Just you.

782
01:06:24,830 --> 01:06:26,270
快  我没时间了
Now! I haven't any time!

783
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:28,510
-怎么了  -被刺了
- What happened? - I was stabbed.

784
01:06:28,990 --> 01:06:30,290
心脏填塞
Cardiac tamponade.

785
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:33,070
你穿的是什么
What are you wearing?

786
01:06:39,770 --> 01:06:40,550
胸腔没问题
Chest cavity is clear.

787
01:06:40,550 --> 01:06:44,760
不  血液  积在围心囊
No, the blood... is in the pericardial sac.

788
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:48,140
不不不
No. No no no no no no no!

789
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:49,180
斯蒂芬  斯蒂芬
Stephen! Stephen!

790
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:51,420
撑住  撑住
Come on. Come on.

791
01:07:17,610 --> 01:07:19,030
再往上一点
Just a little higher.

792
01:07:20,850 --> 01:07:22,460
小心针头
Please be careful with the needle.

793
01:07:24,410 --> 01:07:25,260
斯蒂芬
Stephen?

794
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:30,880
-这是什么  -我的魂体
- What am I seeing? - My astral body.

795
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,400
你死了吗
Are you dead?

796
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:35,510
不  克里斯汀  但我要死了
No, Christine, but I am dying.

797
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:38,210
对了
Right.

798
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:39,680
好吧
Right.

799
01:07:40,910 --> 01:07:43,290
好  好吧
Yeah. All right. Okay.

800
01:07:53,510 --> 01:07:55,640
我从没见过这样的伤口
I've never seen a wound like this.

801
01:07:55,970 --> 01:07:57,280
你被什么刺伤了
What were you stabbed with?

802
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:58,750
我不知道
I don't know.

803
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:21,890
-我现在得消失了  -什么
- I'm gonna have to vanish now. - No, what?

804
01:08:22,050 --> 01:08:23,400
别让我死  好吗
Keep me alive, will you?

805
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:27,500
好
Okay!

806
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:28,830
好
Okay.

807
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:54,340
糟了
Oh shit!

808
01:09:25,310 --> 01:09:26,650
{\an8}{\pos(183,167)}充电至200焦

809
01:09:31,990 --> 01:09:33,110
醒醒  醒醒
Come on, come on.

810
01:09:38,230 --> 01:09:39,300
斯蒂芬  醒醒
Stephen, come on.

811
01:09:42,070 --> 01:09:43,110
再电我一次
Hit me again!

812
01:09:44,110 --> 01:09:45,360
别这样
Stop doing that!

813
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:46,950
提高电压  再电我一次
Up the voltage and hit me again.

814
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:48,900
-不  你的心脏跳了  -照做吧
- No, your heart is beating! - Just do it!

815
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:52,480
天啊
Oh my God.

816
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:58,600
{\an8}{\pos(193,177)}充电至360焦

817
01:09:58,600 --> 01:09:59,050
{\an8}{\pos(188,167)}不要碰触病人  按电击键

818
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:23,030
天啊
Oh god! Oh god!

819
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:25,080
-你没事吧  -嗯
- Are you ok? - Yeah.

820
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:27,190
好了
Okay.

821
01:10:33,210 --> 01:10:36,950
过了这么久  你突然出现
After all this time, you just show up here,

822
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:40,490
魂体飞出身体
flying out of your body?

823
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,000
我知道
Yeah, I know.

824
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:44,570
我也想你
I missed you too, by the way.

825
01:10:46,570 --> 01:10:49,090
我给你发了邮件  你从来不回
I wrote you emails, but you never responded.

826
01:10:49,170 --> 01:10:49,990
为什么要回
Why would I?

827
01:10:51,570 --> 01:10:53,730
克里斯汀  我太抱歉了
Christine, I am so, so sorry.

828
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:56,150
我为一切道歉  你说得对
For all of it. I mean, you were right,

829
01:10:56,150 --> 01:11:00,390
我是个彻头彻尾的混蛋  我对你太不好了
I was a complete asshole. I treated you so horribly

830
01:11:00,390 --> 01:11:02,640
你应得到更好的对待
and you deserved so much more.

831
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:05,240
别说了  你显然是受惊了
Stop. You... you're clearly in shock.

832
01:11:06,330 --> 01:11:08,260
到底怎么回事
I mean, what the hell is happening?

833
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:10,140
你去哪了
Where have you been?

834
01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:14,030
西药没能治好我后
Well, after Western medicine failed me,

835
01:11:14,030 --> 01:11:17,520
我去了东方  最终来到加德满都
I headed East, and I ended up in Kathmandu.

836
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:19,160
-加德满都  -对
- Kathmandu? - Yeah.

837
01:11:20,730 --> 01:11:22,060
鲍勃·西格歌里唱的那个
What, like the Bob Seger song?

838
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:24,630
1975年的《美丽失意者》A面
1975, Beautiful Loser, side A. Yeah.

839
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:26,790
然后我去了一个叫卡马塔奇的地方
And then, I went to a place called Kamar-Taj

840
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:29,560
跟一位叫古一法师的人
and I talked to someone

841
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:33,090
聊了聊  然后
called the Ancient One, and...

842
01:11:33,170 --> 01:11:34,860
-所以你加入了邪教  -不是
- So you joined a cult. - No, I didn't.

843
01:11:35,050 --> 01:11:36,580
不算是
Not exactly. No. I mean,

844
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:38,310
他们确实教我挖掘
they did teach me to tap into powers

845
01:11:38,310 --> 01:11:39,860
我之前闻所未闻的能量
that I never even knew existed.

846
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:42,300
-听起来就像是邪教  -不是邪教
- Yeah, that sounds like a cult. - It's not a cult.

847
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:44,950
-邪教徒就会这么说  -不
- Well, that's what a cultist would say. - Oh, no.

848
01:11:45,380 --> 01:11:46,930
等等  斯蒂芬
Wait, Stephen, wait.

849
01:11:47,310 --> 01:11:48,370
你想做什么
What do you think you're doing?

850
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:49,740
邪教集会我要迟到了
I'm late for a cult meeting.

851
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:55,750
-简直是疯了  -是啊
- This is insane. - Yeah.

852
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:57,460
你要去哪
Where are you going?

853
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,170
你能跟我说实话吗
Can you tell me the truth?

854
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:02,900
一位强大的魔法师
Well, a powerful sorcerer,

855
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:04,560
把自己献给了一个远古实体
who gave himself over to an ancient entity

856
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:05,930
他能打破物理法则
Can bend the very laws of physics,

857
01:12:05,930 --> 01:12:07,340
还拼命想杀了我
tried very hard to kill me,

858
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:09,100
但我把他铐在格林尼治村了
but I left him chained up in Greenwich Village,

859
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:11,370
回到那个地方最快的办法是走传送门
and the quickest way back there is through a dimensional gateway

860
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:12,790
我在清洁间开了一个
that I opened up in the mop closet.

861
01:12:12,790 --> 01:12:14,610
好吧  不说算了
Okay. Don't tell me. Fine.

862
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:26,860
我真的得走了
Really do have to go.

863
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:15,860
斯特兰奇
Strange!

864
01:13:18,730 --> 01:13:19,690
你没事
You're okay.

865
01:13:20,210 --> 01:13:22,470
相对而言  是的  我没事
A relative term, but yeah, I'm okay.

866
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:24,660
悬浮斗篷
The Cloak of Levitation.

867
01:13:25,890 --> 01:13:27,100
它找上你了
It came to you.

868
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:29,400
了不起
No minor feat.

869
01:13:30,550 --> 01:13:31,870
它可花心了
It's a fickle thing.

870
01:13:32,090 --> 01:13:33,140
他逃走了
He's escaped.

871
01:13:33,450 --> 01:13:34,790
-卡西利亚斯  -对
- Kaecilius? - Yeah.

872
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:38,290
他能随意折叠空间和物质
He can fold space and matter at will.

873
01:13:38,590 --> 01:13:41,640
他能在镜像次元外折叠物质
He folds matter outside the mirror dimension?

874
01:13:42,070 --> 01:13:43,780
-在真实世界中  -对
- In the real world? - Yeah.

875
01:13:44,210 --> 01:13:45,970
-还有几个  -两个
- How many more? - Two.

876
01:13:47,130 --> 01:13:48,740
我把一个丢在了沙漠里
I stranded one in the desert.

877
01:13:49,490 --> 01:13:51,590
-另一个呢  -他的尸体就在大厅里
- And the other? - His body's in the hall.

878
01:13:52,070 --> 01:13:53,730
多拉姆法师在门厅里
Master Drumm is in the foyer.

879
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:55,790
他被带回卡马塔奇了
He's been taken back to Kamar-Taj.

880
01:13:55,790 --> 01:13:57,420
伦敦圣殿沦陷了
The London Sanctum has fallen.

881
01:13:57,420 --> 01:13:59,680
只剩下纽约和香港的
Only New York and Hong Kong remain now

882
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:01,690
来抵御黑暗次元
to shield us from the Dark Dimension.

883
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:05,400
你保卫了遭受袭击的纽约圣殿
You defended the New York Sanctum from attack.

884
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:07,640
这里的法师走了  需要一位新的
With its Master gone, it needs another,

885
01:14:07,870 --> 01:14:09,270
斯特兰奇法师
Master Strange.

886
01:14:12,230 --> 01:14:13,070
不
No.

887
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:16,240
我是斯特兰奇博士
It is Dr. Strange.

888
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:18,840
不是斯特兰奇法师[硕士]或斯特兰奇先生
Not Master Strange, not Mr. Strange,

889
01:14:19,180 --> 01:14:20,750
是斯特兰奇博士
Doctor Strange.

890
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:25,380
我成为医生时  曾发誓不伤害他人
When I became a doctor, I swore an oath to do no harm.

891
01:14:25,380 --> 01:14:28,200
而我刚刚就杀了一个人  我不会做第二次了
And I have just killed a man! I'm not doing that again.

892
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:31,220
我当医生是为了救人而非杀人
I became a doctor to save lives, not take them.

893
01:14:31,220 --> 01:14:34,940
你当医生主要是为了救一条生命
You become a doctor to save one life above all others.

894
01:14:35,130 --> 01:14:36,090
你自己的
Your own.

895
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:38,920
还是能看穿我  是吧
Still seeing through me, are you?

896
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:40,660
我看到的是我一直所见的
I see what I've always seen.

897
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:43,000
你过于膨胀的自我
Your overinflated ego.

898
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:46,480
你想回到之前  你能够掌控一切的妄想
You want to go back to the delusion that you can control anything,

899
01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:47,950
甚至掌控死亡
even death,

900
01:14:48,370 --> 01:14:49,700
然而没人能控制死亡
which no one can control.

901
01:14:50,090 --> 01:14:52,710
伟大的斯蒂芬·斯特兰奇博士也不行
Not even the great doctor Stephen Strange.

902
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:54,600
多玛姆也不行
Not even Dormammu?

903
01:14:56,490 --> 01:14:58,060
他能让人永生
He offers immortality.

904
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:00,800
正是我们对死亡的恐惧给了多玛姆生命
It's our fear of death that gives Dormammu life.

905
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:03,670
-他以此为食  -正如你以他为食
- He feeds off it. - Like you feed on him?

906
01:15:04,690 --> 01:15:06,190
你跟我说掌控死亡
You talk to me about controlling death.

907
01:15:06,190 --> 01:15:07,300
我知道你是怎么做的
Well, I know how you do it.

908
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:10,370
我看过了《卡里奥斯特罗之书》里缺失的法事
I've seen the missing rituals from the book of Cagliostro.

909
01:15:11,570 --> 01:15:14,470
千万当心你接下来要说的话  博士
Measure your next words very carefully, doctor.

910
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:16,620
因为你可能不喜欢听吗
Because you might not like them?

911
01:15:16,630 --> 01:15:19,380
因为你可能不知道你在说什么
Because you may not know of what you speak.

912
01:15:19,670 --> 01:15:22,570
-他在说什么  -我在说她的长命
- What is he talking about? - I'm talking about her long life.

913
01:15:22,570 --> 01:15:24,290
她不死的缘由
The source of her immortality.

914
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:29,390
她从黑暗次元汲取能量来维持生命
She draws power from the Dark Dimension to stay alive.

915
01:15:31,710 --> 01:15:32,860
那不是真的
That's not true.

916
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:35,240
我见过那些法事  想明白了
I've seen the rituals, worked them out.

917
01:15:36,190 --> 01:15:37,410
我知道你是怎么做的
I know how you do it.

918
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:42,250
等他们重组  狂热信徒就会回来
Once they regroup, the zealots will be back.

919
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,530
你们会需要支援
You'll need reinforcements.

920
01:15:52,390 --> 01:15:54,060
她不是你以为的那样
She is not who you think she is.

921
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:55,680
你没资格那么说
You don't have the right to say that.

922
01:15:56,310 --> 01:15:58,770
你不知道她肩上担负的责任
You've no idea the responsibility that rests upon her shoulders.

923
01:15:58,770 --> 01:16:00,610
对  我也不想知道
No, and I don't want to know.

924
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:03,550
-你是个懦夫  -因为我不是个杀手吗
- You're a coward. - Because I'm not a killer?

925
01:16:03,550 --> 01:16:05,420
狂热信徒会把我们统统消灭
These zealots will snuff us all out,

926
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:08,020
而你却不能振作起来  先消灭他们
and you can't muster the strength to snuff them first?

927
01:16:08,020 --> 01:16:11,360
-你以为我刚刚做了什么  -你救了你自己
- What do you think I just did? - You saved your own life!

928
01:16:12,230 --> 01:16:14,890
然后像只受伤的狗一样不停抱怨
And then whined about it like a wounded dog.

929
01:16:14,890 --> 01:16:16,290
而你就能轻松做到吗
You would have done it so easily?

930
01:16:16,290 --> 01:16:17,610
你无法想象
You've no idea,

931
01:16:18,130 --> 01:16:19,450
我做过的事
the things I've done...

932
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:22,280
答案是没错
And the answer is yes.

933
01:16:23,370 --> 01:16:26,320
-毫不犹豫  -即使还有别的办法
- Without hesitation. - Even if there's another way?

934
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:29,730
-没有别的办法  -是你缺乏想象力
- There is no other way. - You lack imagination.

935
01:16:29,730 --> 01:16:31,180
不  斯蒂芬
No, Stephen.

936
01:16:31,310 --> 01:16:34,830
是你缺少骨气
You lack a spine.

937
01:16:39,850 --> 01:16:40,900
他们回来了
They're back.

938
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:49,000
我们得了结此事
We have to end this.

939
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:50,000
快
Now!

940
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:58,440
斯特兰奇  下来战斗
Strange! Get down here and fight!

941
01:16:59,150 --> 01:17:00,190
不要
No.

942
01:17:04,530 --> 01:17:06,140
镜像次元
The Mirror Dimension.

943
01:17:06,510 --> 01:17:08,730
你在这里无法影响真实世界
You can't affect the real world in here.

944
01:17:09,390 --> 01:17:11,980
现在是谁得意呢  混蛋
Who's laughing now, asshole?

945
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:15,280
是我
I am.

946
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:31,130
我拿了他的悬戒  他们跑不了的  对吧
I've got his sling ring. I mean, they can't escape, right?

947
01:17:32,430 --> 01:17:33,180
快跑
Run!

948
01:17:50,940 --> 01:17:52,300
他们与黑暗次元的联系
Their connection to the Dark Dimension

949
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:54,570
使他们在镜像次元里更为强大
makes them more powerful in the Mirror Dimension.

950
01:17:54,610 --> 01:17:56,920
他们不能影响真实世界  但还是能杀了我们
They can't affect the real world, but they can still kill us.

951
01:17:56,930 --> 01:17:58,250
这并不明智
This wasn't cleverness.

952
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:00,070
这是自杀
It was suicide!

953
01:18:16,530 --> 01:18:18,470
真好笑
That is hilarious.

954
01:19:04,890 --> 01:19:06,350
这是个错误
This was a mistake.

955
01:20:39,010 --> 01:20:40,300
是真的
It's true.

956
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:44,270
她真的从黑暗次元汲取能量
She does draw power from the Dark Dimension.

957
01:20:48,070 --> 01:20:49,450
卡西利亚斯
Kaecilius.

958
01:20:51,940 --> 01:20:53,260
我投奔你时
I came to you,

959
01:20:54,110 --> 01:20:54,990
心碎
broken,

960
01:20:54,990 --> 01:20:56,220
迷失
lost,

961
01:20:56,310 --> 01:20:57,190
需要帮助
in need.

962
01:20:57,190 --> 01:21:01,060
我信任你做我的导师  你却满口谎言
Trusted you to be my teacher, and you fed me lies.

963
01:21:01,060 --> 01:21:02,670
我是想保护你
I tried to protect you.

964
01:21:02,710 --> 01:21:04,940
-真相会伤害我吗  -你自己会
- From the truth? - From yourself.

965
01:21:05,150 --> 01:21:06,670
如今我有新导师了
I have a new teacher now.

966
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:09,100
多玛姆在欺骗你
Dormammu deceives you.

967
01:21:09,970 --> 01:21:12,510
你不知道他的真面目
You have no idea what he truly is.

968
01:21:12,530 --> 01:21:16,430
他所谓的永生并非天堂  而是无尽的煎熬
His eternal life is not paradise, but torment.

969
01:21:16,430 --> 01:21:17,390
骗子
Liar.

970
01:22:13,820 --> 01:22:14,960
克里斯汀
Christine!

971
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:16,670
开什么玩笑
Are you kidding me?

972
01:22:18,620 --> 01:22:19,740
我的天
Oh my god.

973
01:22:21,710 --> 01:22:23,850
不是心房颤动  她心肌顿抑
It's not fibrillation. She has a stunned myocardium.

974
01:22:23,850 --> 01:22:24,960
-神经性休克吗  -对
- Neurogenic? - Yes.

975
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:31,670
拿棉签
Someone get the swabs.

976
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:35,380
尼克
Nic?

977
01:22:38,140 --> 01:22:40,050
我们得降低她的脑压
We need to relieve the pressure on her brain.

978
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:44,270
她心率在下降
She's still dropping.

979
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:45,750
她快不行了
We're losing her!

980
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:47,020
得给她加氧
We need to increase her oxygen!

981
01:22:47,020 --> 01:22:49,320
-急救车推过来  -她的瞳孔放大了
- I need a crash cart! - Her pupils have dilated!

982
01:22:50,140 --> 01:22:52,630
无反射能力  也读不到脑部活动了
No reflexes. We're not reading any brain activity.

983
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:05,600
你在做什么
What are you doing?

984
01:23:06,910 --> 01:23:08,220
别这样  你快死了
Come on. You're dying!

985
01:23:17,410 --> 01:23:19,820
你得马上回到身体里  你没时间了
You have to return to your body now. You don't have time.

986
01:23:19,820 --> 01:23:23,920
时间是相对的  你的身体还没倒地呢
Time is relative. Your body hasn't even hit the floor yet.

987
01:23:25,910 --> 01:23:29,500
我花了太多岁月窥视未来
I've spent so many years peering through time,

988
01:23:29,790 --> 01:23:31,990
看这一刻
looking at this exact moment.

989
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:33,730
却看不到之后
But I can't see past it.

990
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:37,710
我阻止了无数种可怕的未来
I've prevented countless terrible futures.

991
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:40,290
一次接着一次  永无休止
And after each one, there's always another.

992
01:23:40,810 --> 01:23:42,460
都将我带到这一刻
And they all lead here,

993
01:23:43,290 --> 01:23:44,230
但也止于这一刻
but never further.

994
01:23:44,230 --> 01:23:46,140
你觉得自己死于这一刻
You think this is where you die.

995
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:49,470
想知道我在你的未来看到什么吗
You wonder what I see in your future?

996
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:50,890
不想
No.

997
01:23:52,910 --> 01:23:53,950
想
Yes.

998
01:23:54,470 --> 01:23:57,950
我从未看到过你的未来  只能看到其可能性
I never saw your future. Only its possibilities.

999
01:23:58,730 --> 01:24:01,580
你有行大善的能力
You have such a capacity for goodness.

1000
01:24:01,660 --> 01:24:03,410
你总是很出众
You always excelled,

1001
01:24:03,570 --> 01:24:05,450
但并非因为你渴望成功
but not because you crave success,

1002
01:24:06,190 --> 01:24:08,330
而是因为你害怕失败
but because of your fear of failure.

1003
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:10,480
正因此我才是一位优秀的医生
That's what made me a great doctor.

1004
01:24:10,730 --> 01:24:13,420
正因此你无法成就伟业
It's precisely what kept you from greatness.

1005
01:24:14,410 --> 01:24:16,570
傲慢和恐惧仍绊着你
Arrogance and fear still keep you

1006
01:24:16,580 --> 01:24:19,810
让你无法学会最简单也最重要的一课
from learning the simplest and most significant lesson of all.

1007
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:21,180
是什么
Which is?

1008
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:25,310
你并不重要
It's not about you.

1009
01:24:29,390 --> 01:24:30,510
你第一次来找我时
When you first came to me,

1010
01:24:30,510 --> 01:24:34,000
问我是如何治愈了乔纳森·潘伯恩
you asked me how I was able to heal Jonathan Pangborn.

1011
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:36,100
我没有
I didn't.

1012
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:42,080
他将次元能量引入体内
He channels dimensional energy directly into his own body.

1013
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:45,750
-他靠魔法行走  -时刻如此
- He uses magic to walk. - Constantly.

1014
01:24:46,150 --> 01:24:47,970
他可以选择
He had a choice,

1015
01:24:48,770 --> 01:24:50,840
是回到原来的生活
to return to his own life

1016
01:24:51,260 --> 01:24:53,480
还是为比小我更伟大的事业做贡献
or to serve something greater than himself.

1017
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:55,650
所以我的手能复原吗
So, I could have my hands back again?

1018
01:24:56,420 --> 01:24:57,770
我能回到从前的生活吗
My old life?

1019
01:24:58,580 --> 01:24:59,700
可以
You could.

1020
01:25:00,810 --> 01:25:03,640
而世界会因此变得更加危险
And the world would be all the lesser for it.

1021
01:25:05,220 --> 01:25:08,140
我厌恶从黑暗次元汲取能量
I've hated drawing power from the Dark Dimension.

1022
01:25:08,580 --> 01:25:09,670
但你知道
But as you well know,

1023
01:25:09,670 --> 01:25:12,170
人有时必须打破规则
sometimes one must break the rules

1024
01:25:12,170 --> 01:25:14,050
才能够成就伟大的事业
in order to serve the greater good.

1025
01:25:14,060 --> 01:25:15,780
莫多不会这么觉得
Mordo won't see it that way.

1026
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:18,820
莫多的灵魂刚强不屈
Mordo's soul is rigid and unmovable,

1027
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:21,300
那是他青春的火焰锻造的品性
forged by the fires of his youth.

1028
01:25:21,550 --> 01:25:25,290
他需要你的变通  就像你需要他的力量
He needs your flexibility, just as you need his strength.

1029
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:30,250
你们只有共同努力  才有希望阻止多玛姆
Only together do you stand a chance of stopping Dormammu.

1030
01:25:30,530 --> 01:25:31,620
我还没准备好
I'm not ready.

1031
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:35,610
没人会准备好
No one ever is.

1032
01:25:37,110 --> 01:25:39,260
时机由不得我们选
We don't get to choose our time.

1033
01:25:43,430 --> 01:25:45,570
是死亡赋予了生命意义
Death is what gives life meaning.

1034
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:49,050
知道自己生命有限
To know your days are numbered,

1035
01:25:49,470 --> 01:25:51,200
人生苦短
your time is short.

1036
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:55,740
按说都这么久了  我应该准备好了
You'd think after all this time I'd be ready.

1037
01:25:56,720 --> 01:25:57,800
但你看看我
But look at me,

1038
01:25:58,420 --> 01:26:01,300
无限延长片刻时间
stretching one moment out into a thousand,

1039
01:26:01,670 --> 01:26:03,940
就为了看雪景
just so that I can watch the snow.

1040
01:26:42,860 --> 01:26:44,070
你还好吗
Are you okay?

1041
01:26:52,110 --> 01:26:55,330
-我不明白是怎么回事  -我知道
- I don't understand what's happening. - I know.

1042
01:26:56,220 --> 01:26:59,290
但我得走了
But I have to go away now.

1043
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:06,750
你曾说失去我的手未必是末路
You said that losing my hands didn't have to be the end,

1044
01:27:06,750 --> 01:27:08,390
也可以是开端
that it could be a beginning.

1045
01:27:08,820 --> 01:27:09,740
对
Yeah.

1046
01:27:11,470 --> 01:27:14,080
因为还有其他方式可以拯救生命
Because there are other ways to save lives.

1047
01:27:17,270 --> 01:27:18,650
更艰难的方式
A harder way.

1048
01:27:21,130 --> 01:27:22,770
更怪异的方式
A weirder way.

1049
01:27:23,190 --> 01:27:26,910
帕尔默医生  请前往急诊室
Dr. Palmer, to the ER, please. Dr. Palmer, to the ER.

1050
01:27:31,250 --> 01:27:32,900
我不希望你走
I don't want you to go.

1051
01:28:21,230 --> 01:28:22,340
停下
Stop.

1052
01:28:27,580 --> 01:28:30,910
{\an8}{\pos(192.5,159)}香港

1053
01:28:52,290 --> 01:28:53,760
好好选择武器
Choose your weapon wisely.

1054
01:28:57,520 --> 01:28:59,530
谁都别想闯进圣殿
No one steps foot in this Sanctum.

1055
01:29:02,050 --> 01:29:03,030
谁都别想
No one.

1056
01:29:19,030 --> 01:29:20,190
卡西利亚斯
Kaecilius.

1057
01:29:20,610 --> 01:29:22,810
你站错了队  王
You're on the wrong side of history, Wong.

1058
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:38,390
-她死了  -你是对的
- She's dead. - You were right.

1059
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:41,830
她并不是我以为的那样
She wasn't who I thought she was.

1060
01:29:42,470 --> 01:29:44,170
她很复杂
She was complicated.

1061
01:29:49,090 --> 01:29:50,420
复杂
Complicated?

1062
01:29:53,870 --> 01:29:55,840
黑暗次元不稳定
The Dark Dimension is volatile.

1063
01:29:56,210 --> 01:29:57,280
危险
Dangerous.

1064
01:29:58,340 --> 01:29:59,870
如果她被控制了呢
What if it overtook her?

1065
01:30:01,530 --> 01:30:03,700
她教导我们那是禁忌
She taught us it was forbidden,

1066
01:30:04,690 --> 01:30:08,460
她自己却汲取其能量  来盗取数世纪的寿命
while she drew on its power to steal centuries of life.

1067
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:10,430
她做了她以为正确的事
She did what she thought was right.

1068
01:30:10,660 --> 01:30:12,330
代价终究会来
The bill comes due.

1069
01:30:13,430 --> 01:30:14,540
你还不明白吗
Don't you see?

1070
01:30:16,230 --> 01:30:19,430
她的犯忌导致狂热信徒投向多玛姆
Her transgressions led the zealots to Dormammu.

1071
01:30:19,430 --> 01:30:20,820
卡西利亚斯
Kaecilius

1072
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:23,700
是她的错
was her fault.

1073
01:30:23,980 --> 01:30:27,630
而我们现在  就在面对她欺瞒的后果
And here we are, in the consequence of her deception.

1074
01:30:30,820 --> 01:30:32,100
浴火的世界
A world on fire.

1075
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:34,150
莫多  伦敦圣殿已经沦陷
Mordo,London Sanctum has fallen.

1076
01:30:34,750 --> 01:30:36,660
纽约圣殿也两次遭到袭击
The New York one has been attacked. Twice.

1077
01:30:36,660 --> 01:30:38,370
你清楚他们接下来要去哪
You know where they're going next.

1078
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:40,040
香港
Hong Kong.

1079
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:42,490
你曾叫我战斗  就好像我命系于此
You told me once to fight like my life depended on it,

1080
01:30:42,490 --> 01:30:43,660
因为有一天  或许真会如此
because one day, it might.

1081
01:30:43,660 --> 01:30:45,180
那一天已经到来
Well, today is that day.

1082
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:47,920
我不能一个人打败他们
I cannot defeat them alone.

1083
01:31:05,740 --> 01:31:07,320
圣殿已经沦陷
The Sanctum's already fallen.

1084
01:31:15,150 --> 01:31:16,600
黑暗次元
The Dark Dimension.

1085
01:31:18,650 --> 01:31:20,450
多玛姆来了
Dormammu is coming.

1086
01:31:22,630 --> 01:31:23,990
太迟了
It's too late.

1087
01:31:24,220 --> 01:31:25,720
没有什么能阻止他了
Nothing can stop him.

1088
01:31:27,790 --> 01:31:29,190
未必
Not necessarily.

1089
01:31:33,490 --> 01:31:34,430
不
No.

1090
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:17,140
咒语起效了
The spell's working.

1091
01:32:18,940 --> 01:32:20,600
我们有第二次机会
We've got a second chance.

1092
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:02,980
不
No!

1093
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:12,570
王
Wong!

1094
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:23,690
打破自然法则  我知道
Breaking the laws of nature, I know.

1095
01:34:25,610 --> 01:34:26,800
别现在停下
Well, don't stop now.

1096
01:34:28,820 --> 01:34:30,100
等圣殿复原
When the Sanctum is restored,

1097
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:32,380
他们会再次发起攻击  我们得守住
they'll attack it again. We've gotta defend it.

1098
01:34:32,380 --> 01:34:33,270
走吧
Come on!

1099
01:35:02,260 --> 01:35:04,650
起来  斯特兰奇  起来战斗
Get up, Strange. Get up and fight!

1100
01:35:05,470 --> 01:35:06,920
我们可以做个了结
We can finish this.

1101
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,690
你无法抵抗不可避免之事
You can't fight the inevitable.

1102
01:35:13,350 --> 01:35:14,690
多美啊
Isn't it beautiful?

1103
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:18,800
超越时间的世界
A world beyond time.

1104
01:35:21,670 --> 01:35:22,980
超越死亡
Beyond death.

1105
01:35:27,110 --> 01:35:28,500
超越时间
Beyond time...

1106
01:35:28,940 --> 01:35:29,930
斯特兰奇
Strange!

1107
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:03,570
他走了
He's gone.

1108
01:36:05,220 --> 01:36:08,150
就连斯特兰奇也抛下你们  屈服于他的力量
Even Strange has left you and surrendered to his power.

1109
01:36:40,410 --> 01:36:43,070
多玛姆  我来谈条件
Dormammu! I've come to bargain.

1110
01:36:43,070 --> 01:36:46,490
你是来受死的
You've come to die.

1111
01:36:46,580 --> 01:36:50,760
你的世界现在是我的了
Your world is now my world,

1112
01:36:51,220 --> 01:36:53,950
就像所有世界一样
like all worlds.

1113
01:37:23,350 --> 01:37:26,480
多玛姆  我来谈条件
Dormammu! I've come to bargain.

1114
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:29,710
你是来受死的
You've come to die.

1115
01:37:30,110 --> 01:37:33,170
你的世界现在是我的了...
Your world is now my...

1116
01:37:33,940 --> 01:37:35,550
这怎么回事
What is this?

1117
01:37:36,220 --> 01:37:37,510
幻觉吗
Illusion?

1118
01:37:37,630 --> 01:37:40,730
-不  是真的  -那就好
- No, this is real. - Good.

1119
01:37:50,830 --> 01:37:53,410
多玛姆  我来谈条件
Dormammu! I've come to bargain.

1120
01:37:53,410 --> 01:37:56,920
你...怎么回事
You've... what is happening?

1121
01:37:57,890 --> 01:38:00,650
就像你给卡西利亚斯你的次元的力量
Just as you gave Kaecilius powers from your dimension,

1122
01:38:00,650 --> 01:38:02,950
我也从我的世界带来了一份力量
I brought a little power from mine.

1123
01:38:03,690 --> 01:38:05,960
这是时间
This is time.

1124
01:38:06,370 --> 01:38:09,680
无尽循环的时间
Endless looped time.

1125
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:12,730
你好大胆
You dare!

1126
01:38:12,730 --> 01:38:14,340
该死...
Oh, fu...

1127
01:38:15,630 --> 01:38:17,630
多玛姆  我来谈条件
Dormammu! I've come to bargain.

1128
01:38:18,750 --> 01:38:20,860
你不能永远这么做
You cannot do this forever.

1129
01:38:21,530 --> 01:38:22,640
其实  我能
Actually, I can.

1130
01:38:23,300 --> 01:38:25,020
现在就这样了
This is how things are now.

1131
01:38:25,710 --> 01:38:30,170
你和我  困在这一刻里  无穷无尽
You and me, trapped in this moment, endlessly.

1132
01:38:30,170 --> 01:38:33,730
那你就永生永世地死吧
Then you will spend eternity dying.

1133
01:38:34,020 --> 01:38:37,570
是啊  但地球上的人都能得以存活
Yes. But everyone on Earth will live.

1134
01:38:37,570 --> 01:38:39,280
但你会受尽折磨
But you will suffer.

1135
01:38:40,120 --> 01:38:41,790
痛苦跟我很熟了
Pain's an old friend.

1136
01:38:44,490 --> 01:38:45,520
多玛姆
Dormammu!

1137
01:38:45,980 --> 01:38:48,840
-我来谈条件  -停下
- I've come to bargain. - End this!

1138
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:49,630
多玛姆
Dormammu!

1139
01:38:49,630 --> 01:38:50,410
多玛姆
Dormammu!

1140
01:38:50,410 --> 01:38:51,510
多玛姆
Dormammu!

1141
01:39:07,620 --> 01:39:10,260
你永远不会赢的
You will never win.

1142
01:39:11,870 --> 01:39:12,930
是啊
No...

1143
01:39:13,780 --> 01:39:15,180
但我可以输
But I can lose.

1144
01:39:16,010 --> 01:39:17,110
一遍
Again,

1145
01:39:17,660 --> 01:39:18,700
又一遍
and again,

1146
01:39:19,420 --> 01:39:20,680
无穷
and again,

1147
01:39:21,170 --> 01:39:22,900
无尽  直到永远
and again, forever.

1148
01:39:24,770 --> 01:39:27,880
-那样你就是我的囚徒  -不
- And that makes you my prisoner. - No.

1149
01:39:28,030 --> 01:39:29,150
停下
Stop!

1150
01:39:29,410 --> 01:39:31,910
停下来
Make this stop!!!

1151
01:39:32,350 --> 01:39:34,510
放了我
Set me free!

1152
01:39:35,230 --> 01:39:36,240
不
No.

1153
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:38,510
我来谈条件
I've come to bargain.

1154
01:39:40,390 --> 01:39:42,720
你想要什么
What do you want?

1155
01:39:44,540 --> 01:39:46,740
把你的狂热信徒从地球上带走
Take your zealots from the Earth.

1156
01:39:47,300 --> 01:39:49,420
结束你对我的世界的袭击
End your assault on my world.

1157
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:51,470
永远别回来
Never come back.

1158
01:39:52,140 --> 01:39:54,970
照做  我就结束循环
Do it, and I'll break the loop.

1159
01:40:05,150 --> 01:40:06,430
起来  斯特兰奇
Get up, Strange.

1160
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:07,840
起来战斗
Get up and fight!

1161
01:40:08,380 --> 01:40:09,910
我们可以做个了结
We can finish this.

1162
01:40:10,570 --> 01:40:11,940
多美啊
Isn't it beautiful?

1163
01:40:13,890 --> 01:40:15,970
超越时间的世界
A world beyond time.

1164
01:40:18,890 --> 01:40:20,140
超越死亡
Beyond death.

1165
01:40:32,280 --> 01:40:35,060
-你做了什么  -我谈妥了条件
- What have you done? - I made a bargain.

1166
01:40:38,580 --> 01:40:39,700
这是怎么回事
What is this?

1167
01:40:40,380 --> 01:40:41,290
这是
Well, it's,

1168
01:40:41,290 --> 01:40:43,050
你想要的一切
it's everything you've ever wanted.

1169
01:40:44,140 --> 01:40:46,360
永生  成为唯一的一部分
Eternal life as part of the One.

1170
01:40:49,130 --> 01:40:51,110
你不会喜欢的
You're not gonna like it.

1171
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:12,970
你真该把整本书偷走的
You know, you really should have stolen the whole book,

1172
01:41:12,970 --> 01:41:14,500
因为警告
because the warnings...

1173
01:41:15,210 --> 01:41:17,720
警告是写在咒语后面的
the warnings come after the spells.

1174
01:41:27,670 --> 01:41:28,950
真好笑
That's funny.

1175
01:41:56,140 --> 01:41:57,180
我们成功了
We did it.

1176
01:42:00,190 --> 01:42:01,300
是啊
Yes.

1177
01:42:02,090 --> 01:42:03,490
我们成功了
Yes, we did it.

1178
01:42:04,840 --> 01:42:08,170
也是靠违反自然法则
By also violating the natural laws.

1179
01:42:08,970 --> 01:42:11,180
看看你周围  都结束了
Look around you. It's over.

1180
01:42:11,660 --> 01:42:14,710
你还是觉得不会产生后果吗  斯特兰奇
You still think there will be no consequences, Strange?

1181
01:42:16,070 --> 01:42:17,600
不会有代价
No price to pay?

1182
01:42:18,240 --> 01:42:21,170
我们跟她一样  打破了法则
We broke our rules, just like her.

1183
01:42:22,180 --> 01:42:25,810
代价终究会来
The bill comes due.

1184
01:42:26,740 --> 01:42:28,030
总会来的
Always.

1185
01:42:28,730 --> 01:42:29,930
总有清算的一天
A reckoning.

1186
01:42:33,030 --> 01:42:35,470
我不会再走这条路了
I will follow this path no longer.

1187
01:43:09,750 --> 01:43:11,220
好吧
Yeah, okay.

1188
01:43:20,510 --> 01:43:21,930
明智之举
Wise choice.

1189
01:43:22,650 --> 01:43:24,620
你今后还会有机会戴阿戈摩托之眼
You'll wear the eye of Agamotto

1190
01:43:24,670 --> 01:43:26,610
等你掌握其法力之后
once you've mastered its powers.

1191
01:43:27,090 --> 01:43:28,230
在那之前
Until then,

1192
01:43:29,300 --> 01:43:32,310
最好别戴着无限宝石满街乱跑
best not to walk the streets wearing an infinity stone.

1193
01:43:32,310 --> 01:43:33,400
什么
A what?

1194
01:43:34,470 --> 01:43:36,310
你或许有魔法天赋
You might have a gift for the mystic arts,

1195
01:43:36,310 --> 01:43:38,430
但你还有很多要学
but you still have much to learn.

1196
01:43:39,910 --> 01:43:41,400
古一法师的死
Word of the Ancient One's death

1197
01:43:41,400 --> 01:43:43,470
很快将在多元宇宙里传开
will spread through the multiverse.

1198
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:46,630
地球没有至尊法师维护了
Earth has no Sorcerer Supreme to defend it.

1199
01:43:46,890 --> 01:43:48,900
-我们必须做好准备  -我们会的
- We must be ready. - We'll be ready.

1200
01:46:27,490 --> 01:46:30,740
{\an8}{\pos(192,175)}奇异博士

1201
01:46:30,530 --> 01:46:34,040
{\an8}奇异博士

1202
01:46:35,690 --> 01:46:38,990
地球上现在还有魔法师了
So, Earth has wizards now, huh?

1203
01:46:40,810 --> 01:46:41,820
喝茶吗
Tea?

1204
01:46:42,440 --> 01:46:43,910
我不喝茶
I don't drink tea.

1205
01:46:43,910 --> 01:46:45,260
你喝什么
What do you drink?

1206
01:46:46,150 --> 01:46:47,400
不喝茶
Not tea.

1207
01:46:50,850 --> 01:46:53,900
我有一份关注名单  都是来自
So, I keep a watchlist of individuals and beings

1208
01:46:53,900 --> 01:46:56,550
其他世界  可能对这个世界构成威胁的人
from other realms that may be a threat to this world.

1209
01:46:56,550 --> 01:47:00,240
你的领养弟弟  洛基  就是其中之一
Your adopted brother, Loki, is one of those beings.

1210
01:47:02,380 --> 01:47:04,880
-的确该加上他  -嗯
- Worthy inclusion. - Yeah.

1211
01:47:06,430 --> 01:47:09,880
为什么带他来纽约
So, why bring him here to New York?

1212
01:47:09,880 --> 01:47:11,830
这说来话长
It's a bit of a long story.

1213
01:47:12,140 --> 01:47:14,270
家庭闹剧  之类的
Family drama, that kind of thing, but...

1214
01:47:14,300 --> 01:47:15,800
我们在找我父亲
we're looking for my father.

1215
01:47:16,590 --> 01:47:19,170
好吧  如果你们找到了奥丁
Oh, okay. So, if you found Odin,

1216
01:47:19,170 --> 01:47:23,040
你们都会马上回阿斯加德吗
you'd all return to Asgard, promptly?

1217
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:24,490
是的  马上
Oh, yes. Promptly.

1218
01:47:24,490 --> 01:47:25,870
太好了
Great.

1219
01:47:27,300 --> 01:47:28,690
我来帮你吧
Allow me to help you.

1220
01:53:30,040 --> 01:53:31,120
有事吗
Can I help you?

1221
01:53:32,390 --> 01:53:35,410
他们拿担架把你抬去了卡马塔奇
They carried you into Kamar-Taj on a strecher.

1222
01:53:36,760 --> 01:53:39,140
瞧瞧你现在的样子  潘伯恩
Look at you now. Pangborn.

1223
01:53:40,350 --> 01:53:41,370
莫多
Mordo.

1224
01:53:44,290 --> 01:53:46,000
我能为你做什么  哥们
So, what can I do for you, Man?

1225
01:53:46,120 --> 01:53:49,480
我离开了数月  想通了一件事
I've been away for many months now and I've had a revelation.

1226
01:53:50,860 --> 01:53:53,080
魔法师的真正意图
The true purpose of a sorcerer

1227
01:53:53,560 --> 01:53:56,230
就是扭曲事物应有的形态
is to twist things out of there proper shape.

1228
01:53:57,250 --> 01:53:58,660
盗取能量
Stealing power,

1229
01:53:59,620 --> 01:54:01,090
败坏自然
perverting nature...

1230
01:54:01,780 --> 01:54:02,850
就像你
like you.

1231
01:54:03,990 --> 01:54:06,420
我没偷什么  这是我的力量
I've stolen nothing. This is my power.

1232
01:54:07,210 --> 01:54:08,080
我的
Mine.

1233
01:54:08,080 --> 01:54:09,090
力量
Power...

1234
01:54:10,360 --> 01:54:11,770
是有目的的
has a purpose.

1235
01:54:26,020 --> 01:54:27,730
你为什么这么做
Why are you doing this?

1236
01:54:28,250 --> 01:54:31,770
因为我终于明白这世界的问题出在哪了
Because I see at long last what's wrong with the world.

1237
01:54:36,820 --> 01:54:38,730
有太多魔法师
Too many sorcerers.

1238
01:54:41,110 --> 01:54:44,780
{\an8}{\pos(192.5,152)}奇异博士还将回归
